Connecting starts the LiDAR and sends data continuously in ASCII.

Each line is one full turn, meaning each turn is separated with a '\n'

The data has this form : d1:a1;d2:a2; ... ;dn:an\nd1:a1;d2:a2; ... ;dn:an\n ...

dn is the distance in mm in float for the Nth point
an is the angle in degrees in float for the Nth point

N might vary
